# 🪙 Bitkuy Platform

> A professional trading platform created to manage a very unprofessional poker debt.

Bitkuy is an internal office exchange for a fictional stablecoin called **AuCoin (AUC)**.

1 AUC = 100 THB

The peg is backed by a single real-world reserve:
Au's responsibility.

---

## Background

One day our friend Au played poker.

Result:
Total Loss: 21,000 THB

Paying everyone back individually was operationally complex,
socially awkward,
and repeatedly delayed.

So instead of collecting cash...

we invented a financial system.

---

## AuCoin (AUC)

AuCoin is a fixed-supply stablecoin used to settle poker games inside the office.

Total Supply: 210 AUC

Why 210?

Because:
21,000 THB / 100 THB = 210 AUC

For the first time in history,
a cryptocurrency is fully backed by a single employee.

---

## How it works

Instead of cash:

lose  → transfer AUC
win   → receive AUC
cope  → open the market

Players can trade AUC among themselves until Au eventually obtains fiat liquidity.

---

## Tokenomics

Total Supply: 210 AUC
Mint: disabled (Au not allowed to lose more)
Burn: when Au pays real money
Halving: HR intervention

Scarcity model:
Finite supply backed by finite patience.

---

## Security

Bitkuy uses a next-generation consensus algorithm:

Proof of Shame (PoS)

If a participant refuses to settle:
- reputation decreases
- future credit denied
- nickname permanently assigned

---

## System Architecture

Backend: Node.js (probably works)
Database: office memory
Cache: group chat
Monitoring: people staring at you
High Availability: at least 3 witnesses

No blockchain is used.
Trust issues are processed off-chain.

---

## Example API

POST /transfer
from: you
to: coworker
amount: 2 AUC
note: "next time I win for sure"

POST /salary
trigger: Au receives salary
effect: liquidity injection

POST /panic-sell
trigger: Au seen buying coffee
effect: market instability

---

## Disclaimer

Bitkuy is:
- not a bank
- not an exchange
- not regulated
- not legal advice

AuCoin has no intrinsic value.

Except to the exact people Au owes money to.

---

## Final Words

We did not build this because we believe in crypto.

We built this because Au said:

"I'll pay at the end of the month."

And we needed collateral.
